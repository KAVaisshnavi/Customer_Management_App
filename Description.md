Customer Management Application – Description

The Customer Management Application is a full-stack web application built using React JS, Node.js with Express.js, and SQLite. The application demonstrates core CRUD functionality with a clean and modular architecture, focusing on usability, relational database design, and smooth client-server interaction.

The system enables users to create, view, update, and delete customer records while supporting multiple addresses per customer through a properly normalized database schema. It uses React Router for seamless page navigation and RESTful APIs for reliable data exchange between the frontend and backend.

The application includes basic form validation, search and filter functionality, and clear user feedback messages, ensuring a simple yet intuitive user experience. The design prioritizes clean code, maintainability, and correctness over complex production-level features, making it suitable for technical assessments and interviews.
